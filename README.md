# Paragon Technology and Innovation Sales Analysis

The objective of this project is not just to create a forecasting model, but to create one that accurately predicts Iekly sales for the next month. It's not just about making guesses, but about using historical sales data to identify patterns and trends, and making predictions based on those patterns. Beyond that, I will try to analyze how the performance of each products towards the set KPI, which I will assume based on the average of sales. By doing so, I hope I can help Paragon to plan their inventory and staffing levels more effectively, ensuring that they are always prepared for changes in demand.

To achieve this goal, I will take the following steps: 
- Gather historical sales data and analyze it to identify trends and patterns that could be useful in predicting future sales. 
- I will select an appropriate forecasting model and train it using the historical data, adjusting the parameters as necessary to optimize performance. 
- I will then evaluate the model using a holdout dataset, making any necessary adjustments to ensure its accuracy and reliability. 
- Finally, I will use the trained model to forecast Iekly sales for the next month based on the most recent sales data available.
